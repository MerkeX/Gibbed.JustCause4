## What?

*Experimental!*

* **Unpack**: Unpacker for `.tab`/`.arc` archive file pairs.
* **LaunchWithDropzone**: Game launcher that will start Just Cause 4 with the correct arguments to use the `dropzone` directory and all available game data.

    By default it will use English for voiceovers, you can override this to a different language.

    `LaunchWithDropzone.exe eng|fre|ger|ita|spa|rus|pol|jap|bra|mex|ara|kor|tzh|szh`
    
    ie:
    * `LaunchWithDropzone.exe ara`
    * `LaunchWithDropzone.exe jap`
    * `LaunchWithDropzone.exe szh`

## Instructions
